HOW TO USE 'PHOTO BOOTH'
========================================
0. Open Photobooth.html in 'Firefox'
1. Take your photo -- you can retake as much as you want
2. Click on the sticker
3. You can transform sticker's shape in following ways:
	3.1) zoom in/out by pressing '+'/'-' key
	3.2) move in 4 directions by pressing arrow key
	3.3) rotate clockwise/counterclockwise by pressing SHIFT+left arrow/SHIFT+right arrow
	**WARNING** you should not move sticker when it is rotated unless it is 0 degree or 180 degree rotated (it still has some bugs T^T)
4. You cannot save the picture, however, you can take the screenshot to get the photo :)
